It is well-known that speech production exhibits various nonlinear and time-varying phenomena, due to the nature of the underlying physics. As one of the simplest modulation schemes, amplitude modulation (AM) has found many applications both in broad -casting (AM radio and TV video broadcasting) as well as in point-to-point communications (vintage walkie-talkies). 

WHY WE NEED MODULATION??
	Coupling EM wave into space - antenna size a wavelength 
•	For speech signal f = 3 kHz ð l = 105m
•	Antenna size without modulation @ l = 105m = 60 miles
•	Practically unrealizable
•	Hence, efficient antenna of realistic physical size is needed for
            radio communication system
	Information signal must conform to the limitation of its channel
(channel matching)
	Reduce the effect of interference, e.g. Spread Spectrum
	Place signals at desired frequency band for signal processing purposes such as filtering, amplification, multiplexing
	Used to map digital information sequence into waveforms
